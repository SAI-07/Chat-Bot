# OpenAI Chat Bots for Various Applications



Description:
This project contains three different chat bots that utilize OpenAI's GPT-3 API for various applications, including generating app ideas, creating a general chat bot, and providing real estate investment advice. 

Chat Bot 1
The first chat bot generates app ideas in response to user input. Users can start a conversation by asking the bot for 3 ideas for apps they could build with OpenAI APIs, and the bot responds with suggestions.

Chat Bot 2
The second chat bot is a more general-purpose bot that can be customized based on user input. Users can specify the type of chat bot they want to create, and the bot is ready to assist. Users can input various messages, and the bot generates appropriate responses based on the context of the conversation.

Chat Bot 3
The third chat bot is specifically designed for real estate investment and negotiation. Users can ask for advice, insights, or answers to real estate-related questions and the bot utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 API to provide accurate and relevant information.
