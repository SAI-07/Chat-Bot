      "As an AI language model, I can certainly give you some ideas for apps that could be built with OpenAI APIs! Here are three:\n",

      "1. AI Writing Assistant: An app that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to help users write better content. The app could suggest changes to sentence structure, provide alternatives to overused words, and even generate content based on a user's writing patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. AI Chatbot: A chatbot that uses OpenAI's DialoGPT model to simulate human-like conversation. The chatbot could be used in customer service scenarios or as a companion app that users can interact with to get advice, have a conversation or just chat.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. AI Content Generator: An app that uses OpenAI's API to generate content for various purposes, such as social media posts, articles, or marketing copy. With the GPT-3 language model, the app could generate high-quality content that matches the user's specific requirements and provide suggestions for further customization.\n",

      "top 5 real estate tips\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Determine your needs and wants: Before you start looking for a property, it's essential to establish what you need and want in a home. Consider your budget, location, size, amenities, and features. This will help you to narrow down your options and make the right choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Work with a reputable agent: Working with a qualified and trustworthy real estate agent can make a world of difference when buying or selling a property. A professional agent will provide you with valuable insights into the local market, help you find the right property, negotiate the best deals, and guide you through the buying or selling process.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Do your research: It's crucial to gather as much information as possible about the property, its location, and the neighborhood before making an offer. Researching the area's crime rates, property values, schools, and amenities can help you make an informed decision and avoid any unpleasant surprises down the line.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Get pre-approved for a mortgage: Getting pre-approved for a mortgage can give you an advantage when buying a property. It shows sellers that you're serious about buying and have the financial means to do so. Additionally, it can help you to determine your budget and avoid wasting time looking at properties that are out of reach.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Consider the future: When buying a property, it's essential to think about the long-term. Consider the potential for appreciation, the availability of public transportation, and any future developments or changes that may affect the value of the property. A property that meets your current needs may not necessarily meet your needs in the years to come, so it's essential to think ahead.\n",
